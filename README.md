Password Encryption
Passwords are encrypted using bcryptjs on the client side before being sent to the server for authentication.
This ensures secure password storage and reduces the risk of password theft.
Patient Bot
The Patient Bot is designed to interact with patients, provide general information, answer common questions, and assist in managing patient inquiries. It is integrated directly into the system and can be accessed from the Patient route.

Future Enhancements
Real-time Chat: Add real-time chat functionality between doctors and patients.
Doctor Scheduling: Implement a scheduling system for doctors to manage patient appointments.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile version of the app for better accessibility.
Advanced Search: Improve the search functionality for better patient record retrieval.
